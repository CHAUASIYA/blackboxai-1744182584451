# AI Image Generator

## Project Overview
The AI Image Generator is a web application that allows users to create stunning images based on text prompts using artificial intelligence. Users can specify the style of the generated image and download their creations directly from the platform. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a simple, user-friendly interface.
